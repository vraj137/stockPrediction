# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

## Overview
This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. It leverages historical stock prices fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library and utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the LSTM model.

## Features
- Data Collection: Fetch historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance based on user-provided ticker symbols.
- Data Preprocessing: Normalize the stock prices using Min-Max scaling to prepare them for LSTM training.
- Model Building: Construct an LSTM neural network model to learn from the historical data and predict future stock prices.
- Model Training: Train the LSTM model using historical data up to the current date.
- Prediction: Make predictions for future stock prices, both in the short term and for the next day.
- Visualization: Plot actual and predicted stock prices to visually compare the model's performance.
